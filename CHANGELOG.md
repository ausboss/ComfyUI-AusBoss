# Changelog

All notable changes to ComfyUI-AusBoss are documented here.

## 1.0.0

- Added `AUSBOSS_NODES_ImageCropRotatePad`.
- Added `AUSBOSS_NODES_VideoCropRotatePad`.
- Added a shared full-screen rotate, crop, and pad editor with compact node previews.
- Added exact video-frame preview routes and input-folder/local-path modes.
- Added generated-area masks covering transparency, rotation voids, and padding.
- Added rich node help, example workflows, automated backend/frontend tests, and Registry metadata.
- Editor rotated-size math now matches Pillow's `expand=True` output exactly at every angle.
- Video frame preview uses keyframe seeking with a sequential fallback, so scrubbing long videos stays fast.
- Editor previews of local paths outside ComfyUI's folders are opt-in via `AUSBOSS_TRANSFORM_LOCAL_PREVIEW=1`; queued workflows are unaffected.
