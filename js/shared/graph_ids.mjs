// ComfyUI identifies a node inside a subgraph by its execution id: the chain
// of subgraph node ids that reaches it, colon-joined ("12:3" is node 3 inside
// the subgraph node 12 holds). Only the last segment is a real graph node id,
// and ids are numbered independently inside each subgraph, so looking the
// bare tail up on the root graph does not merely miss - it can return a
// completely unrelated top-level node that happens to share the number.
// Walking the chain is the only way to answer correctly; an id that does not
// resolve returns null, because acting on the wrong node is worse than doing
// nothing at all.
