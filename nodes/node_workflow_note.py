"""Workflow Note 🆎 — the card that makes a shared workflow self-explanatory.

The whole node is a presentation surface: a title banner, a short how-to in
Markdown, the models it needs with download buttons and the folder each one
goes in, the node packs it depends on, and the author's links. The frontend
checks the model files and node packs against this install and marks each
row installed or missing, so a downloaded workflow tells its new owner what
is left to do before the first run.

The backend keeps one hidden STRING widget holding the card as JSON, so
save/load, undo and the API format all ride LiteGraph's default path. Nothing
executes: the node has no outputs and is never part of the prompt graph.
