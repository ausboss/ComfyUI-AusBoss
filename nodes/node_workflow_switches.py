"""Workflow Switches 🆎 — switch parts of a workflow off and on from one card.

The whole node is a frontend panel: one row per switch, each with an
off | on pill. A switch holds the nodes that were picked for it (a box and
its Save, say), and every group can have a row of its own. Off bypasses those
nodes (or mutes them), on runs them again. The truth lives in the nodes' own
modes; this node stores only which nodes each switch holds and its settings,
in its properties.

It is registered here, with a literal mapping key, so registry scanners and
"install missing custom nodes" can find the pack from a workflow that uses
it. The frontend marks it virtual, so it never enters a prompt. Should an API
prompt name it anyway, it is harmless: it has no inputs and no outputs, it is
not an output node and nothing can depend on it, so ComfyUI accepts the
prompt and never runs it.
