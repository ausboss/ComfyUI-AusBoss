"""Tile planning shared by Tiled Upscale and Tiled Upscale Stitch.

Numbers only, no tensors, so the plan can be tested as arithmetic. One sum
covers every case a size control has to handle:

- the redraw size is the size asked for, but never more than ``max_growth``
  times the picture's own megapixels and never less than one tile, so a
  small picture is not redrawn far past the detail it has;
- the redraw is cut into ``k x k`` tiles of the picture's own shape, one tile
  for anything up to about ``tile_megapixels``;
- whatever the redraw is short of the size asked for is made up afterwards
  by a plain enlargement.
